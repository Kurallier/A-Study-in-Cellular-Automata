# **A Study in Cellular Automata**

## Main Objective:

To study Manovich's third characteristic of "new media" via Cellular Automata.  
[*New Media: A User's Guide*](http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/new-media-a-user-s-guide)

## Why?:

## How:

- This study will be using Conway's Game of Life as a foundation to study Cellular Automata, and iterations on it such a Lenia.
- This study will be visuallized to a user by an interactable program containing all of the algorithms.
    -This software will be written in C, using the SDL2 libaries to provide the visuals.
- This study will show the progression of the iterations of Conway's Game of life, and John Von Neuman's Universal Constuctor.

# TODO/Roadmap:

- [x] Program a draft of Conway's Game of Life
- [x] Begin the real project
- [ ] Program Conway's Game of Life
- [ ] Program the iterations that I want to display
    - [ ] Soundlife
    - [ ] Lenia
