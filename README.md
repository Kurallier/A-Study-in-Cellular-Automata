# **A Study in Cellular Automata**

## Main Objective:
To study Manovich's third characteristic of "new media" via Cellular Automata.

## Why?:

## How:
* This study will be using Conway's Game of Life as a foundation to study Cellular Automata, and iterations on it such a Lenia.
* This study will be visuallized to a user by an interactable program containing all of the algorithms.
    * This software will be written in C, using the SDL2 libaries to provide the visuals.
* This study will show the progression of the iterations of Conway's Game of life, and John Von Neuman's Universal Constuctor.

# Roadmap:
- [ ] Program a draft of Conway's Game of Life
- [ ] Begin the real project
- [ ] Program Conway's Game of Life
