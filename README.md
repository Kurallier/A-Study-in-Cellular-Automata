# **A Study in Cellular Automata**

## Main Objective:

To study Manovich's third characteristic of "new media" via Cellular Automata.  
[*New Media: A User's Guide*](http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/new-media-a-user-s-guide)

## Why?:

## How:

- This study will be using Conway's Game of Life as a foundation to study Cellular Automata, and iterations on it such a Lenia.
- This study will be visuallized to a user by an interactable program containing all of the algorithms.
    -This software will be written in C, using the SDL2 libaries to provide the visuals.
- This study will show the progression of the iterations of Conway's Game of life, and John Von Neuman's Universal Constuctor.

    - [ ] Create the Canvas
        - [ ] Random seeding and cell movement 
    - [ ] Game statistics 
    - [ ] Interactability with the Canvas
        - [ ] Keyboard hotkeys and functionality
        - [ ] Mouse/cursor interaction   
    - [ ] Implement a main menu
