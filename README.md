# **A Study in Cellular Automata**

## Objective:
To study Manovich's third characteristic of "new media" via Cellular Automata.

## How:
* This study will be using Conway's Game of Life as a foundation to study Cellular Automata, and iterations on it such a Lenia.
* This study will be visuallized to a user by an interactable program containing all of the algorithms.
* This study will show the progression of the iterations of Conway's Game of life, and John Von Neuman's Universal Constuctor.
